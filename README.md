# Quizlet Scatter
Quizlet has two game modes for the scatter/match game. Scatter involves dragging
pairs, while match is simply clicking pairs. This program plays the match game,
also known as micromatch. The set must be exported with a delimiter
(default is /////) pasted in quizlet.txt. The user must also set coordinates on
the screen for tiles, so the pyautogui knows where to click.
